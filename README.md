# SimpleElectronTracer

Playing with the tracer

## Todo list
1) Play with some OMP
2) Maybe normalization of the vector would be better if it would normalize **this**
3) Make stuff configurable from the cmd (Clara)
4) Make geometry and particle stuff configurable from cofig.json - Property Tree
5) Will it be much better to use std::array for vector and matrices?

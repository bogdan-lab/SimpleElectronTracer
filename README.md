# SimpleElectronTracer

Playing with the tracer

## Todo list
0) Maybe normalization of the vector would be better if it would normalize **this** -- may have better preformence because of less copies

1) Play with some OMP (particle buufer wraper for better bucket split?)
2) Make bufferized writting to the file --> even less problems with memory
5) Will it be much better to use std::array for vector and matrices?

//TODO -- I have several ways to construct Particle. Want to choose construction mechanism before main cycle and than run only the chose one
